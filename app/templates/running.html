    <p>I have always been into sports. Most of my life I've played soccer, at various levels of competition. Once I got into my mid-twenties and was only playing soccer at most a few times a week, I decided to try out running. </p>
 
 <h2> First Half Marathon </h2>

 <p>I signed up for my first half marathon in July, 2013 and ran the Canada Army Run half in September, 2013. Then I ran it again in 2014. However, I never looked at running as something that should be structurd and never really trained other then running when I more or less
    felt like it.
</div>

<h2> Training </h2>

<p> Starting on February 2, 2015 I'll be starting some more structured training. I've chosen Hal Higdon's Intermediate Half as the training plan. I will be logging all workouts with my GPS watch. </p>
